# RAG Agent

The RAG Support Agent is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI agent designed to process and answer queries efficiently.

## **How It Works**

The system follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to improve response accuracy and relevance. It operates through the following steps:

1. **Embedding Text with `all-MiniLM`**

   - The agent uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to convert input queries and stored knowledge into dense vector embeddings.
   - These embeddings enable efficient similarity-based retrieval.

2. **Retrieving Relevant Context**

   - The agent searches a pre-indexed database to retrieve the most relevant pieces of information based on the query.

3. **Generating Responses via any inference API**

This combination of embedding-based retrieval and advanced language model generation ensures **precise, context-aware responses**.

## **Expanding to Your Own Support Agent**

The RAG Support Agent can be customized to work for different projects or knowledge bases by updating the context it uses for retrieval.

### **Modifying the Context Source (`issues.md`)**

By default, the agent retrieves relevant information from `issues.md`, a markdown file containing documented issues and troubleshooting steps. To tailor the agent for your own use case:

1. Open `issues.md` in the repository.
2. Replace or expand the content with relevant support information for your specific project.
3. Ensure the new content is structured clearly, as better formatting improves retrieval accuracy.
4. Restart the agent to index the updated knowledge base.

## **Usage**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/galaxyxtwo/rag-agent
cd rag-agent
```

### **2. Set Up Your API Key**

This agent requires an API key for an Inference api to function. Any OpenAI API compatible endpoint will work.

Export your API key as an environment variable:
`export DEFAULT_API_TOKEN="your-api-key-here"`

### **3. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### **4. Run the Agent**

Run the agent from the root directory of the repository:
`python3 cli.py`
